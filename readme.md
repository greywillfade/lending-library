# Hello, reader!

This dictionary has made use of the lovely [Jessica Lord](http://jlord.us/)'s [Sheetsee](http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/).

It's intended to help people who may be unfamiliar with the world of [OpenActive](http://openactive.io) and the wonderful set of acronyms and terminology that comes along with it. 

You can find the site itself at https://greywillfade.github.io/openactive-dictionary/
